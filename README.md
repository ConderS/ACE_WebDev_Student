# Smart Dashboard

Hey guys! What you have in front of you right now is your very own, personal dashboard. It greets you, gives you a random but inspiring quote, tells you what the time and date is, gets the weather, and keeps track of all your todos. 

Or at least... that's what it's supposed to do. 

You see, it's not quite done yet. It needs some polishing and some of its features still haven't been built. That's what you guys are going to do today.

By the end of this walkthrough, you will learn how to:

 - Customize the background to any color or image
 - Insert your Name and any quote you'd like
 - Build a random quote selector
 - Customize the color of your todos in their different states. In other words, they will display a different color when they're being hovered over, when they're being crossed off, and when they're just being left the way they are.
 - Add in the weekday and date in the clock and style it to look good

As a disclaimer, I am building this webpage with a particular framework called React, and what this means is that you guys are gonna see a lot of different subfolders and a bunch of code written everywhere that's organized in a particular way. Don't worry about any of it besides the specific parts that I lead you through :)

## Alright, let's begin!

What is HTML?

- HTML stands for *Hyper Text Markup Language*
- HTML is a language that describes the structure of a web page element by element, building block by building block. It basically says **what** is on the webpage. Is there text here? Is there an image? Is there a group of elements? [More info...](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)

What is CSS?

-  CSS stands for *Cascading Style Sheets*
- CSS decides **how** HTML  looks. Should this text be blue, or big? Should this part of the webpage be on the left side of the screen? [More info...](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)

What is JavaScript (or JS for short)?
